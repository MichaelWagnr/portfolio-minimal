			<p>
				From an early age I had an interest in computers and technology. My
				father took me to a science exhibit at the University of Saskatchewan,
				where we won an internet router in a raffle contest - becoming one of
				the only families on the block to be online. It was quite a few years
				after that experience that I was first introduced to writing code and
				programming:
			</p>
			<p>
				<Summary>In my early 20s, </Summary>I worked as a Manager for a company
				that had two Python Developers. Their monitors were always a colorful
				splay of highlighted text and I greatly admired their work.{' '}
				<Summary>I began learning </Summary>
				<Tech>SQL</Tech> with the aim of writing database queries for my peers
				and beginning to code.
			</p>
			<p>
				<Summary>
					I made a bit of progress and turned my interest towards{' '}
				</Summary>
				<Tech>Python</Tech> which proved to be a pretty big leap. I put aside
				coding, and moved to Montr√©al where I focused my efforts on learning
				French and playing piano. The challenge of thinking in another language,
				and translating dots on a page into musical performance gave me the
				practice in abstract thinking and confidence boost necessary to attempt
				programming again.
			</p>
			<p>
				<Summary>After having a false start, I decided to start with </Summary>
				something less intimidating: <Tech>HTML</Tech>
				<Summary> and</Summary> <Tech>CSS</Tech>. The momentum was starting to
				pick up.
			</p>
			<p>
				<Summary>The next step was learning </Summary>
				<Tech>JavaScript</Tech>. I was discovering a new technology, but with
				the benefit of having previously studied loops, if/else clauses and
				functions in Python. A great surprise!
			</p>
			<p>
				I was greatly inspired by one of my friends who had taught themself Web
				Development and was able to enter the field on the basis of their own
				efforts; So <Summary>I started to double down on my studies</Summary>,
				consuming a number of online courses and textbooks. I was comfortable
				making <Tech>React</Tech> applications on my own, but my readiness to
				start applying for Developer positions was unmeasured. I decided to
				enroll in a University program to accelerate my path towards entering
				the market.
			</p>
			<p>
				<Summary>
					I began a Full Stack Web Development program through Concordia
					University
				</Summary>
				. I gave it my best effort and made some great friends in the process.
				The curriculum helped me close gaps in my skillset, especially with{' '}
				<Tech>Node.js</Tech> and <Tech>MongoDB</Tech>. Eager to take in as much
				information as possible, I found time outside of class projects to learn{' '}
				<Tech>TypeScript</Tech> and follow a course on using Regular Expressions
				and Git.{' '}
				<Summary>
					I graduated in December of 2022, and have continued learning and
					building projects since
